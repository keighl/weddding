    It was Easter break 2010 at Ithaca College, a four-day weekend where much of the campus emptied. Kyle didn't feel like driving the 6+ hours home to North Falmouth, MA, and Alice couldn't justify flying to Round Rock, TX for less than a week. Their mutual friend had a small birthday party for those who were still around and they both went. Dinner turned into a dance party which then turned into a late night grocery run for ice cream and a late-late night screening of Love Actually. You can figure out the rest.

    …except for the fact that Alice had some reservations about Kyle. She remembered seeing him on the quad earlier surrounded by a crowd of people juggling clubs that were on fire. Campus safety came by to shut it down, but without missing a beat Kyle told them that he was just doing a demonstration for IC Circus (a group that didn't exist). Intriguing but bad news in Alice's eyes.

    Weekend adventures around Ithaca – dates to the Farmer's market, hiking up and down all the famous gorges in town, attempts to make home-cooked meals using communal dorm-room kitchens – convinced Alice that this guy was definitely worth hanging on to despite discovering more strange talents (she learned at one point in life Kyle also learned to ride a unicycle), and they continued to explore life together, first as they both studied abroad in London sophomore year and eventually to NYC post-graduation.

    Months after Alice mastered the “Put a Ring on It” dance by Beyoncé as a hint to be taken very literally, Kyle finally popped the question on a beach on Cape Cod right after Christmas, Alice's favorite Holiday.
