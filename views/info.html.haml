    We're getting married at the Flying Bridge, a restaurant located right on the Falmouth Harbor. The ceremony will take place outdoors under a tent adjacent to the restaurant, and the reception will take place upstairs inside.

    %strong Fun fact:
    Kyle once played a wedding here in a jazz combo with his groomsman, Dave!

      Coming from Boston, the fastest route into Falmouth is via <strong>I-93</strong> and <strong>MA-3</strong> headed South. That will bring you over the <strong>Sagamore Bridge</strong>... a fine bridge indeed.

      Although you'll need to battle the epic and ever-present traffic of I-95 in Connecticut, your reward is an awesome wedding and being on Cape Cod in the middle of Striped Bass season. Take <strong>I-95</strong>, then <strong>I-195</strong> in Providence, and finally take <strong>MA-25</strong> over the <strong>Bourne Bridge.</strong>
