        <h4>ashley moulton - matron of honor</h4>
        <p>Ashmo - formerly known as Ashbo (pre-marriage when her last name was Bookheimer) - and Alice met in college. They both made the jump from Ithaca, NY to New York, NY the summer of 2009 and Alice is so grateful to have such a great friend by her side. Ashley works in children's media, recently transitioning from a show on Nick, Jr. to a web-based children's media startup company. They also are both finishers of the 2013 Cayuga Lake Triathlon. It should also be noted that though Matron of Honor, there is nothing about Ashmo that is matronly. In fact, she is quite sassy.</p>

        <p>Liz and Alice are friends through Kyle's brother, Brendan, who is lucky enough to be her boyfriend. Liz works in the pharmaceutical marketing research industry and is Alice's personal WebMD.com. They're also ski buddies who have perfected the balance between skiing hard & apr&#233;s-ing hard(er).</p>

        <h4>alina pak</h4>
        <p>Alina is Alice's middle sister meaning they've known each other since Alice was 2.5 years old. Alina is the brains of the family, working as an analyst at a biomedical consulting firm, and has been published in a couple science journals. She lives in Boston and is brave enough to both take the Chinatown bus to NYC to visit Alice AND regularly participate in Crossfit classes. They have been known to finish each other's sentences.</p>

        <h4>angie pak</h4>
        <p>Angie - A3 - is the youngest of the Pak sisters. She attends Round Rock High School so much later than when Alice and Alina did that there are no teachers left there to mistake her for her two older siblings. She is a dancer - which is a shock to everyone who considers the dance abilities of the rest of the family - and is much cooler than A1 and A2 ever were in their teens. Angie lives in Round Rock, TX, working hard to ensure the parents don't suffer from Empty Nester's syndrome for at least a few more years.</p>

        <h4>meredith nowikowski</h4>
        <p>Meredith and Alice met at City Year. They learned that the other also ran and started to run in Central Park on Saturday mornings together. Eventually they trained for and finished the DC National SunTrust Marathon with other buddies in the spring of 2011, Alice's first! Meredith is currently the Membership and Marketing Manager at a neighborhood improvement association in NYC. She and Alice were once the pink and yellow Power Rangers respectively for Halloween, which was a hit with bar-hoppers who grew up in the '90s.</p>

        <h4>karen truscott</h4>
        <p>Karen is the littlest Truscott, both in terms of age and size. She recently moved to Chicago to try out the Midwest and with hopes of breaking into the art scene there as she is a painter with serious skills. Alice met Karen when she was only 14 (Angie's age now!) so Alice has seen her grow up. Together with Liz, the three girls shield each other from Kyle and Brendan's shenanigans.</p>

        <h4>julianne snape</h4>
        <p>Julianne - aka Huli - is Alice's best friend from high school. Now married with a baby on the way a few months before K+A's wedding, Huli is preparing for her next big adventure as a mom. Huli lives in Nashville with her hubby and dog. She also has an extensive DVD collection of high school choir concerts, many which feature her and Alice singing and dancing in solo acts... sometimes on chairs. These are not available for rent/purchase/screenings, ever, so please don't ask.</p>

        <h4>brendan truscott - best man</h4>
        <p>Brendan and Kyle are brothers and business partners. They spend a lot of time sitting next to each other in their tiny Brooklyn office. Brendan is the more adventurous of the two and tends to push Kyle's limits on the ski slope. They are probably best described as 'those annoying guys who take things too far.'</p>

        <p>Peter defines modern chivalry, charm and wholesomeness. A close friend from Falmouth, Pete and Kyle were constantly together after school and during the summer. The two of them once wired $200 to Cairo. Ask Pete about it at the wedding. Oh, he's also a peerless table tennis player.</p>

        <p>Steve is likely to be the most attractive person at the wedding. That's sort of the way it goes. Kyle and Steve were roommates for most of their time spent at Ithaca College. Some of their favorite pastimes included listening to Steve sing Roxanne and figuring out where to hide their stolen Wegmans shopping cart.</p>
